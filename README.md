# 🎄 Advent of Code Repository 🎅

Ho Ho Ho! Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! 🌟 This is where I'll be solving the puzzles and spreading some coding joy during the festive season.

## 📅 What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place in December. Each day, a new coding puzzle is released, and participants solve it using their programming skills. It's a great way to challenge yourself, learn new techniques, and celebrate the holiday spirit in code!

## 🚀 Repository Structure

- **[Year 2023](./2023/):** This directory contains my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles in the year 2023.
- ...
- **[Shared](./shared):** Useful helpers collected along the way and a basic `Day` class

Feel free to explore the solutions, and maybe we can share some coding holiday cheer! 🎉

## ⚙️ Running the Solutions

Each year, I'm improving my setup. In 2023, I paste the input in the input file `./2023/XX_input.txt`, create a `DayXX < Day` solver and run `rake solve:part_one day=XX` to get the first solution.

## 🎅 Happy Coding and Merry Christmas! 🎁

May your code be bug-free, and your holidays be filled with joy, laughter, and lots of hot cocoa. Happy Advent of Code! 🚀✨
